This repository contains the souce code based on python which help us to create a block chain arctitecture using a python programming language. There is an crypto.py file which contains all the source code. The file contains some code for genesis block generation and to mine other blocks.



## Installation

You can use the code after cloning our reposiotry into your system

Here we used pipenv shell for an virtual enviroment, although there is no need for the same the reason is that we are not using any library from pypi.org.
